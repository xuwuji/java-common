	/**
	 * When we want to implement a critical section using locks and guarantee
	 * that only one execution thread runs a block of code, we have to create a
	 * ReentrantLock object.
	 * 
	 * At the beginning of the critical section,we have to get the control of
	 * the lock using the lock() method. When a thread (A) calls this method, if
	 * no other thread has the control of the lock, the method gives the thread
	 * (A) the control of the lock and returns immediately to permit the
	 * execution of the critical section to this thread. Otherwise, if there is
	 * another thread (B) executing the critical section controlled by this
	 * lock, the lock() method puts the thread (A) to sleep until the thread (B)
	 * finishes the execution of the critical section.
	 * 
	 * At the end of the critical section, we have to use the unlock() method to
	 * free the control of the lock and allow the other threads to run this
	 * critical section. If you don't call the unlock() method at the end of the
	 * critical section, the other threads that are waiting for that block will
	 * be waiting forever, causing a deadlock situation. If you use try-catch
	 * blocks in your critical section, don't forget to put the sentence
	 * containing the unlock() method inside the finally section.
