	<!-- MyBatis supports configuring multiple dataSource environments so that 
		deploying the application in various environments, such as DEV, TEST, QA, 
		UAT, and PRODUCTION, can be easily achieved by changing the default environment 
		value to the desired environment id value. -->

	<!-- In the preceding configuration, the default environment has been set 
		to development. When deploying the application on to production servers, 
		you don't need to change the configuration much; just set the default environment 
		to the production environment id attribute. -->

			<!-- The JDBC transaction manager is used where the application is responsible 
				for managing the connection life cycle, that is, commit, rollback, and so 
				on. When you set the TransactionManager property to JDBC, behind the scenes 
				MyBatis uses the JdbcTransactionFactory class to create TransactionManager. 
				For example, an application deployed on Apache Tomcat should manage the transactions 
				by itself. -->
			<!-- The MANAGED transaction manager is used where the application server 
				is responsible for managing the connection life cycle. When you set the TransactionManager 
				property to MANAGED, behind the scenes MyBatis uses the ManagedTransactionFactory 
				class to create TransactionManager. For example, a JavaEE application deployed 
				on an application server, such as JBoss, WebLogic, or GlassFish, can leverage 
				the application server's transaction management capabilities using EJB. In 
				these managed environments, you can use the MANAGED transaction manager. -->
			<transactionManager type="JDBC" />
			<!-- • If you set the type to UNPOOLED, MyBatis will open a new connection 
				and close that connection for every database operation. This method can be 
				used for simple applications that have a small number of concurrent users. 
				• If you set the type to POOLED, MyBatis will create a pool of database connections, 
				and one of these connections will be used for the database operation. Once 
				this is complete, MyBatis will return the connection to the pool. This is 
				a commonly used method for developing/testing environments. • If you set 
				the type to JNDI, MyBatis will get the connection from the JNDI dataSource 
				that has typically been con gured in the application server. This is a preferred 
				method in production environments. -->

		<!-- Sometimes, we may need to work with multiple databases within the 
			same application. For example, we may have the SHOPPINGCART database to store 
			all the order details and the REPORTS database to store the aggregates of 
			the order details for reporting purposes. If your application needs to connect 
			to multiple databases, you'll need to configure each database as a separate 
			environment and create a separate SqlSessionFactory object for each database. -->
